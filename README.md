microGPT is a lightweight implementation of the Generative Pre-trained Transformer (GPT) model for natural language processing tasks. It is designed to be simple and easy to use, making it a great option for small-scale applications or for learning and experimenting with generative models.

## Features
-  Lightweight implementation of the GPT models
-  Trained on a [small scaled diverse dataset](https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.08442) (6 GB)
-  Designed to be trained on consumer GPU (RTX 4060 8GB)
-  Small number of parameters (82 Million!)
-  Customizable hyperparameters for model configuration
-  Supports Top K Top P filtering and temperature scaling
-  Written in Python with PyTorch as the deep learning framework

## Installation
1. Clone the repo and run `pip install -r requirements.txt`

## Usage
1. Run `tokenizer/train_tokenizer.py` to generate the tokenizer file. The model will tokenize text based on it.
2. Run `datasets/prepare_dataset.py` to generate dataset files.
3. Run `train.py` to start training~

**Modify the files stated above if you wish to change their parameters.**

## Usage (Inference)
To edit model generation parameters, head over `inference.py` to this section:
```py
# Parameters (Edit here):
n_tokens = 1000
temperature = 0.8
top_k = 0
top_p = 0.9
model_path = 'models/microGPT.pth'

# Edit input here
context = "The magical wonderland of"
```
